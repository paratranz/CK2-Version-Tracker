EVTDESC_LT_10103_A;After a long council meeting, my head is filled with the latest expense reports. I let out a sigh, a small feeling of defeat building in me, but [upbeat_courtier.GetFirstName] interrupts my thoughts: "I don't know if it matters to you, my [Root.GetLordLady], but many are grateful for the way you are handling the surplus of men and women here in the [Root.GetCapitalHolding].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_10103_B;At the end of supper, [upbeat_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] calls me over to [upbeat_courtier.GetHerHis] table, pointing at a tall glass of [Root.GetAlcohol]. "There are many of us who want to personally thank you for your hospitality, my [Root.GetLordLady]. I know space is hard to come by inside the [Root.GetCapitalHolding]." The [upbeat_courtier.GetManWoman] presses my hand and smiles in gratitude.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC_LT_10103_C;During supper, my [upbeat_courtier.GetRootRelation] [upbeat_courtier.GetTitledFirstName] stands up and clears [upbeat_courtier.GetHerHis] throat.

It is not all who would find lodgings for as many as you have managed to, [Root.GetMasterMistress].";;;;;;;;;;;;;x
